### Scope
Project includes a couple of sources for a few major languages. I found that the selected Region doesn't dictate the Privacy Policy url; that seems to be determined just by the assumed primary language of a given country. 


### Contributing
- A scraper would be great. 
- If you'd like to add language, please do. I'll pretty much accept any reasonable pull request I get.
